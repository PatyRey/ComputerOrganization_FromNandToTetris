# ComputerOrganization_FromNandToTetris
For my Computer Organization and Machine Language class (or NAND to Tetris) I'm building a virtual machine from scratch and develop a tetris game that will be play in the computer created.

The project problems can be found in https://www.nand2tetris.org/

The website also comes with a really helpful book
